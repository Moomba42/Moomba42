### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work for Luxoft as a âœ¨ _Senior Software Engineer_ âœ¨. So far the job is very enjoyable!

My best job was probably at CD Projekt RED - the team was amazing and the products are inspiring, especially due to their cultural significance. \
I led the devlopment of the Twitch Drops campaign during the release of the Cyberpunk 2077 DLC - Phantom Liberty ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to use them however you want.
